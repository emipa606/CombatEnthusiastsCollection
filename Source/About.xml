Update 1.1.4.1:
Check mod settings to select a Combat Extended patch,
Restarting is mandatory for the changes to take effect!

A selection of firearms aimed to enhance the vanilla experience, but it's more of a personal collection really. Primarilly balanced around vanilla weapons / Combat Extended and its weapon expansion mods. Credits to Meru for LoadOnDemand, Jecrell for JecsTools, and Andross for several firing sounds. Please report bugs/inconsistencies to the steam workshop page.</description>
